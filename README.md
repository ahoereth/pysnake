# PySnake - a TensorFlow project

This is a project to accompany the course "Implementing Artificial Neural Networks with TensorFlow".

We implement a simple snake game and different playing strategies:

- Human controlled: `python human_snake.py [subjectID]` runs the snake to be controlled with the arrow keys. Supply a subject ID to store the score in `participant[subjectID].csv`.
- Systematic: `python systematic_snake.py [store]` runs the systematic snake. Supply some value as store to store the result into `systematic.csv`.
- Q-Learning: `python q_snake.py` -- details follow
- Evolve: `python evolve_snake.py` -- details follow
